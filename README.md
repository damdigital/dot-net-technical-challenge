## Background

The client wants to be able to record employee's objectives along with a simple list of related tasks that the employee needs to complete in order to meet this objective.

## Requirements
There have been a number of user stories created to record the requirements of this system. The following of which has been assigned to you in order to start the project.

As you will be the developer starting this project do think about how you may wish to architect the solution. Your code will form the foundation of a much bigger project going forward.
